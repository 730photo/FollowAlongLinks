# FollowAlongLinks

This was the 22nd project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed. I built an app where when you hover over links on a page a pill shaped background will both resize itself to fit the width & height of the link and follow you around the page wherever you go.

Things I learned:

-getBoundingClientRect()

Goals:

-Make mobile responsive
